Put your custom hitsounds here!

How to do it: Create a folder with the same name as your hitsound pack's display name (THE VALUE OF "DISPLAYNAME" IN THE PACK'S JSON FILE!)
Add the hitsounds inside of the folder, their name must begin with "hitsound".
Example: hitsound1, hitsound2, hitsound3, etc. (Do not name a hitsound "hitsound0", it won't work.)

NOTE: Keep the name of the folder ALL lowercase, even if the display name has uppercases. It will be handled by the engine automatically.
