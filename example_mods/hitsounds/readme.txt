Put your hitsound .jsons here!

How to do it:

Copy the default.json file in assets/hitsounds/ (if you need a template) and rename it to what you want your pack to be called.
Change "displayname" inside of the file to what you want the file to be named in the options menu. (If 2 jsons have the same "displayname" value, only 1 will be available in the options menu)
